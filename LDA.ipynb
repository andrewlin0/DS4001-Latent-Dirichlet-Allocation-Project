        "The model looked like it did pretty good identifying what each book was about. It pretty much got a 100% on the New Testament, but since we didn't give it a lot of topics to get, it couldn't identify a specific topic from each book. We limited the number of topics to 8 because we found that if we added any more, there would be tons of duplicate topics for some reason. It labeled a bunch of books topic 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "It did not do as well on the Old Testament, but it still did pretty good. From what we believe to be the right books for the topics, they didn't line up. Genesis was labeled as topic 2, while. we think it is either topic 4 or 5. It also labeled a bunch of books topic 6, which looked like to be general words that could appear anywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notable things in this LDA model were that it classified Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John under the same topic and no other book got that topic. This is pretty cool since Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John essentially tell the same story. It also got Revelation and Acts too. For the Old Testament, it got the story of Jonah in a topic and Ruth. It also grouped 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, and 1 Kings into a topic together. This is cool because those three books revolve around King David."
